               primitives are developed for the third‐row elements Ga through
               Kr. The basis functions generalize the 6‐31G and 6‐31G* sets
               commonly used for atoms up to Ar. A reexamination of the 6‐31G*
               basis set for K and Ca developed earlier leads to the inclusion
               of 3d orbitals into the valence space for these atoms. Now the
               6‐31G basis for the whole third‐row K through Kr has six
               primitive Gaussians for 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p orbitals, and a
               split‐valence pair of three and one primitives for valence
               orbitals, which are 4s, 4p, and 3d. The nature of the

               are single set of Cartesian d‐type primitives. The polarization
               functions for transition metals are defined to be a single 7f

               artifacts of the QM/MM transition near the surface, a
               2d-periodic QM treatment of the system is employed. Thus, the
